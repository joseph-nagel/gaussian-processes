# Gaussian process mini project

![An example of Gaussian process regression](assets/predictions.svg "Gaussian process regression")

This repo just contains some random explorations of Gaussian processes (GPs).
For the moment, the mini project only contains a demonstration of GP regression.
It is planned though to address Bayesian optimization in the future.

A number of illustrative notebooks are provided.
They contain a short introduction to GPs in general and an example of GP regression.
Moreover, the Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion is discussed despite the fact
that this representation applies to a wider class of stochastic processes.
